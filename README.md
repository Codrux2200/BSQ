to make this program work ,you need to define a map with **'o'** as obstacles and **'.'** as empty place.
The map should look like 
```

ooooooooooooooo
ooooo..oooooooo
ooooo..oooooooo
ooooo..oooooooo
oooooooo....ooo
......ooooooooo
```
where the number above the map is the number of (colums - 1)

To execute the program, do in a terminal witch is on the repository's folder on your pc:

on linux or mac os:
```
./bsq filepath of the map
```

```
./bsq.exe filepath of the map
```

for exemple, the resolve of this map would be :
```
